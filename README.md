# Marketing-Attribute
Marketing Campaign Response Prediction

This project analyzes and models customer responses to marketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. By leveraging classification algorithms, the system identifies key factors influencing customer behavior and helps optimize campaign targeting.

Features:
ðŸ“ˆ Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing: Feature encoding, normalization, missing value handling.

ðŸ§  Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, ROC AUC.

ðŸ“Š Visualization: Feature importance, performance metrics, and comparison plots.

ðŸ“¤ Business Insight: Identifies high-value customer segments to enhance marketing ROI.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

pandas, numpy â€“ data handling

scikit-learn â€“ ML modeling

matplotlib, seaborn â€“ visualizations

Jupyter Notebook â€“ development environment
